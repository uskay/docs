		<p>Happy new year!!! <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/latest/blog/supporting-open-source-sustainability/">One year ago we announced</a> our New Year’s resolution to help the open-source ecosystem become a little bit more sustainable. This is our one year funding report. For 2019 we intend to continue on our path with significantly increased investment.</p><p>We believe it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/hacker-backdoors-widely-used-open-source-software-to-steal-bitcoin/">is increasingly clear</a> that relying on people’s volunteered free time to drive mission critical open source software is not a sustainable mode of operation. As a community we need to find new ways to fund the valuable work on such projects. We strive to provide at least some financial support to projects that we directly depend on and that are accepting support.</p><h2><strong>Total funding: $32,900 </strong></h2><p>The <a href="https://opencollective.com/amp">projects we supported</a> are</p><figure class="wp-block-image"><amp-img src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.40-am.png?w=660" alt="" class="wp-image-2329 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" srcset="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.40-am.png?w=660 660w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.40-am.png?w=150 150w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.40-am.png?w=300 300w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.40-am.png?w=768 768w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.40-am.png?w=1024 1024w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.40-am.png 1302w" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 660px, 100vw" width="660" height="387"></amp-img></figure><figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><amp-img src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.54-am.png?w=386&amp;h=344" alt="" class="wp-image-2328 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" width="386" height="344" srcset="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.54-am.png?w=386&amp;h=344 386w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.54-am.png?w=772&amp;h=688 772w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.54-am.png?w=150&amp;h=134 150w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.54-am.png?w=300&amp;h=268 300w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2018-12-12-at-7.50.54-am.png?w=768&amp;h=686 768w" sizes="(min-width: 386px) 386px, 100vw"></amp-img></figure><table class="tableizer-table"><thead><tr class="tableizer-firstrow"><th>Projects</th><th>Total contribution</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Babel</td><td>$12,600</td><td>The most used transpilation system for JavaScript.
