The framework has continued to evolve since our time in the Netherlands, including a new governance model and many new publishers and e-commerce websites building with AMP. In fact, we’ve seen remarkable results and growth across the Asia-Pacific region in particular. With recent examples like Indian publisher <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/times_of_india/">Times of India</a>, Australian car insurance website <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/greenslips/">Greenslips.co.au</a>, and Japanese CMS <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/latest/blog/progressively-amplify-ec-cube/">EC-Cube</a>.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><amp-anim src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/tokyo_amp_conf.gif?w=660" alt="" class="wp-image-2321 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" width="660" height="315" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 660px, 100vw"></amp-anim><figcaption>AMP Conf 2019 is headed to Tokyo!</figcaption></figure></div><p>This is why <strong>we’re thrilled to invite you to join us at the next <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/amp-conf/">AMP Conf </a>being held in Tokyo on April 17 and 18</strong>. Come to learn from those working on contributing to AMP, those using the format, and the new committees managing the project’s governance. Whether you speak English or Japanese, you’ll find the talks engaging as we’ll be translating all the presentations into both languages. We’ll have speakers from the web developer community, core AMP contributors and companies and websites who have implemented AMP. Additionally get the latest updates on AMP stories, AMP for email and AMPHTML ads.<br/></p><p>We also want to continue the tradition of including the broader community voices by inviting you to <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/bWdzWs28nUrC6Fq13">submit ideas for talks</a>. We want to hear about the most interesting things you’ve done with AMP, your challenges with AMP in production, how you’ve approached building AMP pages or how AMP’s place in the web ecosystem. <br/></p><p>To apply for a spot at this year’s AMP Conf, <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/amp-conf-2019/registrations/new/">fill out this registration form</a>. You can also express interest to apply for a limited number of scholarships for those who may need travel support, especially from underrepresented communities. If you’re unable to attend in person, we’ll be recording and live streaming all of the talks, so subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXPBsjgKKG2HqsKBhWA4uQw">AMP YouTube channel</a> to catch those videos. </p><p>Stay tuned for details on the specific talk agenda as we get closer to the event! We look forward to seeing many of you in Tokyo in less than 100 days!<br/></p><p><em>Posted by Matt Ludwig, AMP Project marketing lead at Google</em><br/></p><p><br/></p>	</div>
