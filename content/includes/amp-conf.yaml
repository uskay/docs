        Today, we release the Kraken. We’ll introduce `amp-script`, allowing your custom JavaScript to operate within AMP Documents with reasonable limits. Now your custom logic can be expressed with the world’s most popular programming language.

      description: "Too often, engineers view AMP as just one more thing to implement. In reality, AMP provides engineers with a series of guiding principles that can help them deliver more performant websites—even when it comes to non-AMP pages. So, what happens when teams begin to think AMP first? Engineers are able to move beyond mere AMP validation and have a seat at the table in conversations about UX, performance, and even new feature development.  Does that sound crazy? It's not just a pipe dream. In this talk, we will explore AMP's core design principles and unpack how businesses can (and should!) incorporate these principles into all aspects of their decision making.  I will draw on real-life experience and examples from my team's work with top publishers—including LA Times, El Pais, RTL.de, and a recent re-platforming effort at The Washington Post—and reveal how AMP can help teams align on goals and make better decisions at every level."
